# P011 — Module runtime / capability RPC / generation fencing

Phase state: **MERGED**.

## Implemented scope

- durable per-module runtime state in the PCMS storage broker under `core.module-runtime`;
- admitted immutable package/controller activation through the accepted P004 sandbox host;
- bounded FIFO runtime mailbox;
- exact P008 authority-derived capability exposure;
- durable generation/package fencing before and after privileged capability work;
- graceful DRAINING semantics: already-started privileged work may finish, already-accepted mailbox work drains, and new mailbox/capability calls are denied;
- update/disable generation advancement before subsequent replacement activation;
- restart recovery that advances persisted ACTIVE/DRAINING generations and fences stale runtimes;
- RECOVERY_HOLD activation gating;
- no raw WebExtension, native, PersonaMonkey-internal, IndexedDB, migration, scheduler, or second automation authority.

Implementation files:

- `extension/pcms/runtime/errors.js`
- `extension/pcms/runtime/module-runtime.js`

Focused regression files:

- `tests/pcms/p011-harness.mjs`
- `tests/pcms/p011-runtime.test.mjs`
- `tests/pcms/p011-boundary.test.mjs`

The P011 test harness explicitly disposes its sandbox hosts/child runtimes so Node exits cleanly after verification instead of leaving MessagePorts referenced.

## Acceptance mapping

### A011-01 — runtime broker / mailbox

Verified admitted controller activation, durable runtime state, bounded FIFO invocation/serialization, and boundary isolation.

### A011-02 — capability RPC

Verified exact manifest-authority capability exposure, denial of ungranted capabilities, generation-fenced privileged context, and the approved sandbox-host boundary.

### A011-03 — generation fencing / drain / recovery

Verified graceful drain, rejection of new work during drain, generation advancement, stale-context rejection, replacement activation, restart recovery, and RECOVERY_HOLD activation blocking.

## Focused verification actually run

Node: **v22.16.0**

Command:

`node --test tests/pcms/p011-runtime.test.mjs tests/pcms/p011-boundary.test.mjs`

Result: **6 tests passed, 0 failed, exit 0**.

## Independent GitHub CI

P011 branch checkpoint `3ef7ccc526db3f01301b8d1c73427acdc559ca6f`:

- GitHub Actions `verify`, run **300** / run id **37256090667** — **success**;
- GitHub Actions `firefox-developer-edition`, run **295** / run id **37256090762** — **success**.

The standard workflows do not discover `tests/pcms/**`; the focused suite above was therefore executed independently against the byte-verified branch tree.

Merged main commit `de4410938f77ad386c382be0f697057ecbca06fb`:

- GitHub Actions `verify`, run **306** / run id **37256572170** — **success**;
- GitHub Actions `firefox-developer-edition`, run **301** / run id **37256572168** — **success**.

PR #11 is merged. These results, together with the focused acceptance suite above, provide deterministic evidence for A011-01, A011-02, and A011-03.
