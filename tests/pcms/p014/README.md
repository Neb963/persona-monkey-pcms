# P014 — Accounts module + Account↔personaUid binding evidence

Phase state: **MERGED**.

## Implemented scope

P014 introduces the first concrete feature-module state service under `pcms-modules/p014/**`.

- durable account identity is `AccountId`;
- every active account has exactly one dedicated `personaUid`;
- a `personaUid` can belong to at most one account;
- `cookieStoreId` is never durable account identity and appears only in transient reconciliation projections;
- binding and rebinding are revision fenced;
- rebinding also requires the caller's expected old `personaUid`;
- same-`personaUid` rebinding is idempotent so PersonaMonkey container rotation requires no account-state rewrite;
- Persona lookup is read-only and fail closed;
- the module stores no credentials, SecretRefs, browser state, native state, or PersonaMonkey internals.

The state interface is intentionally bounded to `read()` and `compareAndSwap()`; P014 does not directly access PCMS IndexedDB. Persona access is intentionally bounded to a read-only `get(personaUid)` resolver supplied by Core/Persona Broker integration.

## Acceptance mapping

### A014-01 — account model

Covers bounded non-secret account schema, canonical UUID-shaped `personaUid`, provider-ID parity with accepted P013, one-to-one Account↔Persona uniqueness, revision fencing, existing/current Persona validation, additive Persona projection compatibility, and accessor rejection without invoking getters.

### A014-02 — Persona binding / rebind

Covers expected-old-binding fencing, unused replacement Persona enforcement, binding epoch advancement, state CAS fencing, and same-`personaUid` idempotence.

### A014-03 — rotation continuity

Covers unchanged durable account state across `cookieStoreId` rotation, transient current-container projection, fail-closed reconciliation for missing/mismatched/unavailable Persona state, and stale concurrent-write rejection.

## Focused verification actually run

Node: **v22.16.0**

Commands:

```text
node --check pcms-modules/p014/errors.js
node --check pcms-modules/p014/schema.js
node --check pcms-modules/p014/accounts.js
node --test tests/pcms/p014/accounts.test.mjs tests/pcms/p014/boundary.test.mjs

Result: **12 tests passed, 0 failed, exit 0**.

The exact implementation/test Git blobs published at checkpoint `bfb1328656cd78768d51c20ea1d3d9ee0ddd0b79` match the locally executed files:

The local focused tree used a one-line stub for the already-accepted P013 `PERCHANCE_PROVIDER_ID` constant because a full repository clone was unavailable in the execution container. The actual repository P013 contract was independently inspected before implementation; the committed test imports that real repository contract. No other accepted dependency behavior was replaced by the focused harness.

No live provider, Firefox DevTools MCP, credential, or browser-automation acceptance is claimed for P014.
