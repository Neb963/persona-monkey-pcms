# P017 — Refresher module evidence

Phase state: **MERGED**.

## Implemented scope

P017 adds a bounded Refresher feature module under `pcms-modules/p017/**`.

- cohorts are module-owned and bind to durable P014 `AccountId` plus accepted P013 Perchance generator target identity;
- durable state stores generator IDs and SHA-256 source hashes, never generator source bytes, Persona IDs, container IDs, credentials, or secrets;
- `AUTO_RECENT` deterministically selects never-confirmed/oldest-confirmed members while `MANUAL` disables automatic selection;
- daily cohort budget is configurable up to the module bound, uses a configurable offset 24-hour accounting window, and is reserved durably at prepare time so unresolved work cannot oversubscribe it;
- active-hours plus sleep-days cycles are anchored deterministically and remain module-owned policy rather than creating another Core scheduler;
- refresh dispatch uses only accepted P013 `generator.update` through an account-scoped ProviderGate;
- confirmed-effect accounting advances only after the durable RemoteOperation is known `SUCCEEDED`;
- ambiguous provider outcomes enter reconciliation before retry, direct `NOT_APPLIED` releases the reservation and requires a new operation identity, while reconciled retryable work reuses the same durable identity;
- account/provider loss fails closed before dispatch, unresolved work fences policy/source changes, and restart-style ACTIVE state without a RemoteOperation returns to PENDING without replay.

## Acceptance mapping

### A017-01 — cohort/eligibility

Covers durable cohort/member schema, AccountId/provider/target identity, global target ownership, revision fencing, deterministic AUTO_RECENT eligibility, bounded member/cohort capacity, and sensitive/source-byte exclusion.

### A017-02 — schedules/budgets

Covers configurable daily budgets, durable budget reservation, offset 24-hour windows, anchored active-hours/sleep-days cycles, MANUAL mode, deterministic projections, and module-owned schedule policy without a second scheduler.

### A017-03 — isolation/confirmed-effect tests

Covers ProviderGate-only mutation, source hash verification, account/provider failure isolation, direct failure/retry identity, ambiguity reconciliation, restart recovery, unresolved-operation fencing, and confirmed-effect accounting only after SUCCEEDED.

## Focused verification actually run

Node v22.16.0. The focused slice used the exact P017 product source blobs plus the accepted P013 contract surface/stubs needed to execute the module in isolation.
